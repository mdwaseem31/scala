01. Synchronization is for fixing the race condition problem demonstrated while learning Parallel Collections (in ParllelCollect.scala)
02. All objects has a method in them called synchronized. When I used synchronized method, code returned 1000000 (fix to race condition problem)
03. With synchronization, the code run a lot slower and it would be even slower if it is used without par.

01. Apart from slow speed, over synchronization can also lead to deadlock.
02. The situation where one thread is churning away producing forever and another thread waiting for it to happen and this leads to a problem that we refer to as Deadlock.
